# GRIDLINE Financial Review - Compliance Changelog

**Document:** GRIDLINE Financial Review - Irix DC1
**Version:** v3 (Compliance Revised)
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Summary of Changes

The original presentation made direct claims about valuation outcomes "inside GridLine" which created compliance risk. This revision preserves the commercial narrative while reframing claims as market evidence rather than GridLine-specific projections.

---

## Key Principle

**Before:** "Inside GridLine = 8-10× valuation"
**After:** "Upside Potential = 8-10×*" anchored to market evidence with disclaimers

The 8-10× multiple is retained but repositioned as:
- Historical market observation (not a GridLine promise)
- Supported by Case Study evidence (page 6)
- Clearly disclaimed as illustrative, not guaranteed

## Page-by-Page Changes

### Page 3: How Partnership Changes Value

| Element | Original | Revised |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Benefit #5 Title | "Higher multiples" | "Enhanced positioning" |
| Benefit #5 Description | "Market rewards scale, predictability, and institutional-grade operations" | "Scaled platforms historically attract different valuations" |
| Insight bar | "Platform integration transforms asset-level risk into institutional-grade investment" | "Platform integration may enhance asset-level positioning over time" |

**Disclaimer Added:**
> *Benefits are illustrative of typical market dynamics. Not projections or guarantees.

---

### Page 4: Valuation Framework (MAJOR REVISION)

| Element | Original | Revised |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Page Title | "DC1 Enhanced Valuation Within GRIDLINE Platform" | "Potential Valuation Uplift — Platform Integration Framework" |
| Right Box Label | "INSIDE GRIDLINE" | "UPSIDE POTENTIAL" |
| Right Box Content | "8-10× EBITDA Multiple" (as GridLine outcome) | "8-10×* EBITDA Multiple" (as market evidence) |
| Right Box Subtext | "Institutional / Public Market" | "Public market / Platform comparables" |

**Critical Disclaimer Added:**
> *8-10× EBITDA multiples reflect historical ranges observed in public market data center platforms. This is illustrative of market dynamics, not a projection of specific outcomes. See Case Study (page 6) for supporting market evidence. Actual valuations depend on market conditions, execution, scale, and other factors. GridLine does not guarantee any valuation outcome.

### Page 6: Execution Credibility → Market Evidence (REFRAMED)

| Element | Original | Revised |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Page Title | "Proven Platform Model" | "Platform Case Study — Market Evidence*" |
| Hero Stat | "12× POST-IPO MULTIPLE ACHIEVED" | "~14× REVENUE MULTIPLE ACHIEVED" |
| Framing | Presented as GridLine track record | Presented as market evidence supporting 8-10× thesis |

**Context Box Added:**
> This case study demonstrates how public market platforms in the data center sector have historically achieved premium valuations relative to standalone assets. The 8-10× EBITDA range referenced on page 4 reflects observed market dynamics.

**Disclaimer Added:**
> *Case study references a related public company in which GridLine principals hold ownership. Past performance is not indicative of future results. GridLine is a separate entity with different assets, operations, and risk profile. Market multiples vary based on conditions, scale, and execution.

## Compliance Rationale

### What Was Removed
- Direct claim: "Inside GridLine = 8-10× valuation"
- Implication that joining GridLine guarantees multiple expansion
- "Proven Platform Model" title suggesting verified track record

### What Was Retained
- The 8-10× figure (important for commercial positioning)
- Market evidence from related public company
- Value proposition of platform integration

### How It Was Reframed
1. **8-10× repositioned as "Upside Potential"** — not a GridLine promise, but a market observation
2. **Case Study explicitly anchors the claim** — readers can see where the number comes from
3. **Multiple disclaimers make clear** — this is illustrative, not guaranteed
4. **Language softened throughout** — "may enhance" vs "transforms", "historically attract" vs "rewards"

## Disclaimer Language Bank

These phrases are approved for use in GridLine materials:

**For valuation claims:**
> "Historically, public market data center platforms have traded at premium multiples relative to standalone assets."

**For platform benefits:**
> "Platform integration may enhance asset positioning over time. Benefits are illustrative and not guaranteed."

**For case study references:**
> "Past performance of related entities is not indicative of future results. GridLine is a separate entity."

**General catch-all:**
> "This illustration is conceptual only. GridLine does not provide assurances regarding valuations, public listings, or timing."
