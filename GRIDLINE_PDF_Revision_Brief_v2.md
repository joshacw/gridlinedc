**Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Compliance review - remove direct valuation claims, add disclaimers
**Source File:** GRIDLINE_Financial_Review_DESIGNED.pdf

## Summary of Changes

The current PDF contains direct valuation claims that create compliance risk. This revision removes specific multiple claims and reframes value proposition language to be illustrative rather than promissory.

**CHANGE REQUIRED - Item #5**

---

### PAGE 4 - Platform Integration Value (03) ⚠️ CRITICAL

**CHANGE REQUIRED - Remove specific multiple claim**

| Current | Revised |
|---------|---------|
| "INSIDE GRIDLINE *8-10× EBITDA Multiple Institutional / Public Market" | "INSIDE GRIDLINE — Platform Comparables* Institutional / Public Market Framework" |

**Remove the specific "8-10×" figure entirely.**

**CHANGE - Table row "VALUATION"**

| Current | Revised |
|---------|---------|
| "Asset-level EBITDA" → "Platform scale" | "Asset-level metrics" → "Platform-level framework" |

**ADD PROMINENT FOOTER DISCLAIMER:**
> *Valuation frameworks are illustrative only, based on historical public market observations of data center platforms. GridLine does not provide assurances regarding valuations, public listings, or timing. Actual outcomes depend on market conditions, execution, and regulatory factors.*

**DESIGN NOTE:** Consider adding an asterisk (*) next to "Platform Comparables" that references the footer.

---

### PAGE 5 - Transaction Framework (04)

**No text changes required**
Existing footer "Conceptual frameworks for discussion. Subject to negotiation and due diligence." is appropriate.

---

### PAGE 6 - Execution Credibility (05) ⚠️ REQUIRES REFRAME

**CHANGE REQUIRED - Reframe as Case Study**

| Element | Current | Revised |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Page Title | "Proven Platform Model" | "Related Platform Case Study*" |
| Hero Stat | "12× POST-IPO MULTIPLE ACHIEVED" | **REMOVE or replace with:** "Premium Market Positioning Achieved" |

**KEEP these stats** (they're factual about the related company):
- 4 Operating DCs
- $58M Market Cap
- $4M Annual Revenue

**ADD PROMINENT DISCLAIMER:**
> *Case study references a related public company in which GridLine principals hold ownership. Past performance of other entities is not indicative of future results. GridLine is a separate entity with different assets, operations, and risk profile.*

**No changes required**

## New Disclaimer Language Bank

Use these approved phrases throughout as needed:

**For valuation discussions:**
> "Historically, public market data center platforms have traded at different multiples than standalone private assets. GridLine does not guarantee any specific valuation outcome."

**For platform benefits:**
> "Benefits described reflect typical characteristics of scaled platforms and are not projections of specific outcomes for Irix DC1 or any other asset."

**For execution credibility:**
> "References to related entities are illustrative of strategy execution. Past results of other companies are not predictive of GridLine's future performance."

**General footer (can be used on any page):**
> "This document is for discussion purposes only. All projections, frameworks, and comparisons are illustrative and subject to change. Nothing herein constitutes an offer, commitment, or guarantee."

## Design Notes for Kurt

1. **Footer treatment:** Add a subtle footer bar (perhaps in the lighter grey) on pages 3, 4, and 6 to house disclaimers
2. **Asterisk system:** Use asterisks to link claims to their disclaimers
3. **Font size for disclaimers:** 8-9pt, lighter weight than body copy
4. **Maintain visual hierarchy:** The disclaimers should be present but not dominate the page
